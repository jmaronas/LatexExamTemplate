# Latex template for exam creation

A template for latex exam creation.

## Usage

Import examen package. Following conferences there are two ways to import the package, so that solutions are rendered or not. In this way with a single tex file and a minimal change you can create your exam including solutions, and easily create the version for students.

```
\usepackage[solution]{examen} # renders solution
\usepackage{examen} # renders examen for students
```

Follow the `example.tex` file to understand all commands defined to set your subject title, exam duration and so on.
